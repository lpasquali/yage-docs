# CURRENT_STATE

## Living Memory

yage is in active development. The core bootstrap pipeline is functional for Proxmox. The xapiri TUI is being built out as the primary configuration interface. The provider abstraction plan is largely complete: phases A, B, C, and E are done; D is substantially complete. Legacy cleanup is in flight per ADR 0002 (no-backward-compatibility policy).

## Freshness Policy

This file must be updated whenever system state evolves (per CODING_STANDARDS.md "Atomic Persistence"). If information here conflicts with what you observe in the code or git history, trust what you observe now — then update this file to match reality.

Last updated: **2026-04-30** — Architect assessment; phase status corrected; ADR 0002 no-compat policy; 4 cleanup agents spawned

## Version Baseline

| yage-docs | `main` | — | Documentation in progress |

## Recent Changes

### 2026-04-30 — Architect assessment: phase status corrected; ADR 0002 no-compat policy

Architect audited the codebase and produced §25 addendum to `abstraction-plan.md`:

- **Phase status corrected**: CURRENT_STATE previously showed A/B/D/E as "Not started"; ground truth is A/B/E complete, D substantially complete (see Abstraction Plan Status table below).
- **No-backward-compatibility policy adopted** (ADR 0002): yage has no production users; all legacy fallbacks (dual-read/write migration, env-var aliases, Secret-name fallbacks, JSON-format fallbacks) are dead weight and will be deleted without deprecation cycle.
- **Three ADR documents written**: §25 addendum to `abstraction-plan.md`; ADR 0001 (CSI driver registry); ADR 0002 (backward compat removal).
- **Four parallel cleanup agents spawned** to execute ADR 0002 on branches: `refactor/kindsync-cleanup`, `refactor/env-aliases`, `refactor/proxmox-purge-cleanup`, and one additional branch. Status unknown as of this writing — check before starting new work on overlapping files.

### 2026-04-30 — xapiri: config/provision tab split (merged to main)

Split the previous single "Config" tab in xapiri into two separate tabs:
- **Config** (tab 1) — profile selection list and new-config name input
- **Provision** (tab 2) — full interactive edit form for the selected config

Selecting a config from the list automatically switches to the provision tab. All other tabs (3–9) remain gated on `cfgSelected`. Keyboard shortcuts 1–8, ctrl+alt+1–8, and mouse click-to-focus remapped to new indices. Help tab updated. Both branches (`feat/xapiri-config-provision-split` and `main`) point to commit `02b1948` — the branch can be deleted.

### 2026-04-29 — Config system revamp: per-ns layout, fork restore, dual-arch image check (#65)

Merged into `main`. Per-namespace config layout; fork restore logic; dual-arch image presence check at bootstrap.

---

### 2026-04-28 — xapiri + kindsync + pricing: per-config bootstrap Secrets, region-ranked costs, installer TUI API (#64)

Per-config bootstrap Secrets tied to `cfg.ConfigName`; region-ranked cost display in xapiri; installer toolchain exposed via TUI API.

---

### 2026-04-27 — xapiri: mode-filtered provider list + mgmt+workload network config (#63)

Provider list filtered by bootstrap mode; management and workload network config integrated into xapiri walk-through.

---

### 2026-04-26 — xapiri: streaming costs, full config expansion, mouse & log UX (#62)

Live cost streaming in xapiri; full config tree expansion; mouse support and improved log pane UX.

## Abstraction Plan Status

Tracked in [yage-docs ADR](https://lpasquali.github.io/yage-docs/architecture/adrs/abstraction-plan/).

| Phase | Goal | Status |
|---|---|---|
| C | Config namespacing (`cfg.Proxmox*` → `cfg.Providers.Proxmox.*`) | **Merged** |
| A | Inventory behind `Provider.Inventory()` | **Complete** (interface + call sites wired; Proxmox implements; cleanup in progress) |
| B | Plan body delegation per provider | **Complete** (DescribeIdentity/DescribeWorkload/DescribePivot wired; Proxmox implements) |
| D | Generic kindsync + Purge | **Substantially complete** (KindSyncFields + WriteBootstrapConfigSecret in use; legacy wrappers being removed — see ADR 0002) |
| E | Pivot generalization (kind → any-cloud mgmt) | **Complete** (PivotTarget called via interface in pivot.go) |

## Active Work

| Branch | Owner | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `refactor/kindsync-cleanup` | Backend | Delete `SyncProxmoxBootstrapLiteralCredentials` + InfraProvider guards | In progress |
| `refactor/env-aliases` | Backend | Delete `OS_*` / `YAGE_CURRENCY` aliases + snapshot legacy JSON | In progress |
| `refactor/proxmox-purge-cleanup` | Backend | Delete pre-split Secret fallback + move `proxmoxmachines` GVR | In progress |

## Known Issues

- xapiri is still a work-in-progress TUI; not all provider paths are fully wired.
- Cost estimation requires live Proxmox API; returns `ErrUnavailable` when unreachable.

## Next Steps

- Integrate background agents A/B/D1/D4 worktrees (status unknown — check before starting new work on overlapping files).
- Complete ADR 0002 cleanup (4 parallel PRs in flight).
- Continue xapiri walkthrough completeness (all provider fields reachable via TUI).
- xapiri: wire provider fields for DO/Linode/OCI/IBM once epic #18 Backend work lands.
